This repository contains implementations of various algorithms completed as part of our lab exercises. Each lab focuses on a different algorithmic concept, including recursive and iterative approaches, divide and conquer, and greedy strategies. Below is a brief description of each lab:

LAB-1: Binary Search Tree Insertion ðŸŒ³
Topic:
Implement the insertion inside iterative and recursive Binary Search Tree (BST) and compare their performance.

Description: This lab demonstrates the implementation of both iterative and recursive approaches to inserting elements into a Binary Search Tree. The performance comparison highlights the differences between these two methods.
LAB-2: Merge Sort and Quick Sort ðŸ”„
Topic:
Implement divide and conquer-based Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms and compare their performance for the same set of elements.

Description: This lab focuses on two important sorting algorithms: Merge Sort and Quick Sort. By implementing both, we compare their performance when applied to the same dataset.
LAB-3: Matrix Multiplication âž•âž—
Topic:
Compare the performance of Strassen's method of matrix multiplication with the traditional way of matrix multiplication.

Description: In this lab, we explore matrix multiplication using Strassen's method and the traditional method, comparing their efficiency for different matrix sizes.
LAB-4: Activity Selection Problem ðŸŽ¯
Topic:
Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of the greedy approach.

Description: The activity selection problem is implemented to showcase the greedy algorithm approach, which helps in selecting the maximum number of activities without overlapping.
